# MassInk
MassInk - an exporting tool Based on Inkscape vector graphics and Python

Inkscape allows for amazing text customization - but its not great when you have a large set of text/strings and want to export them, as it has to be done manualy for every text/string ...

MassInk fixes that issue ...
The user can manualy create a single SVG file containing a text element with the desired style/look (color, width, stroke...) while MassInk applies that style to the large set of text/strings automaticaly and exports the result
